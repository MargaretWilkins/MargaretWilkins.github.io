        <h2>Musical Reviews</h2>
        <p class="subtext">Hymn to Creation (1973):

Hymn to Creation (1973):

Glasgow Herald: "Textures of extreme clarity and the sense of natural growth the music gives, make this a fascinating and compelling work."<br></br>
Scotsman: "...a keen feeling for punchy orchestral colours and rhythms with a sometimes Straussian sense of humour."<br></br>
Musica Angelorum (1991):

Malcolm Cruise, Huddersfield Examiner: "Musica Angelorum, inspired by medieval paintings portraying multitudes of angels playing instruments, has a marvellously wrought shape. And unlike the oft-heard fragmentary style honoured by many living composers, it displayed, in this splendid performance, a pleasing continuity which generated keen anticipation."<br></br>
Simon Cargill, Yorkshire Post: "...The elevated euphony of Margaret Lucy Wilkins’ Musica Angelorum was all the more welcome...this new score, with its references to the angelic instrumentalists that populate medieval art, emerged freshly minted in a concert pervaded by the all too familiar gambits of the avant-garde’s more recent offerings."<br></br>
Hubert Culot, BBC Music Magazine: "Musica Angelorum for string orchestra is another study in string writing and, in every respect, as successful and attractive as Burnt Sienna. Many arresting moments in this atmospheric piece that vastly repays repeated hearings. Wilkins has a real feeling for and liking of string textures."<br></br>
Orpheus (1973):

Times Educational Supplement: "Contains many interesting passages where plucked notes inside the piano were made to balance structurally against pizzicato and tremolando effects from the violin."<br></br>
Burnt Sienna: Etude for String Trio (1974):

Scotsman: "A series of studies, cogently and excitingly presented of the different dramatic sonorities obtainable from a string trio."<br></br>
Aspects of Night (1981):

Michael Ball: "...marvellous humour and variety of gesture.... richly entertaining...the inventiveness and sense of colour in small spaces."<br></br>
Epistola da San Marco (1987):

David Briers, Huddersfield Examiner: "A powerful essay for brass band, with trumpets thundering at the back of the hall."<br></br>
Playtime (1985):

Huddersfield Examiner: "Local children’s poems are the inspiration behind the piece and though there is nothing straightforward about the music’s tonality or structure, the children took it warmly to their hearts."<br></br>
A Dance to the Music of Time (1980):

Huddersfield Examiner: "...a delicate woven subject, treated in a precise and disciplined manner, though managing without seeming effort, to create endlessness, a feeling of suspension, maintained despite lively rhythmic pulses."<br></br>
Study in Black & White No.1 (1983):

Meirion Bowen, Guardian: "A notable exception extended a Bartokian idiom with power, panache and real ingenuity."<br></br>
Study in Black & White No.2 (1992):

Dmitri van der Werf, De Haagse Courant: "Heel wat verrassender waren Margaret Lucy Wilkins’ bijzonder overtuigende Study in Black & White No.2."<br></br>
KANAL (1990):

David Hammond, Huddersfield Examiner: "KANAL implies a channel - a way through - as well as a canal. It is an intriguing, metaphoric title for an intriguing work, which makes use of texts from writers as far apart as Blake and Brecht, and mixes words and music, movement and light, in an abstract, and at times quite exciting fashion.... Apart from the solo oboe and percussion, most of the live music comes from a large number of brass players, in different locations, and the score provides for a rich texture of resonant sound, rising, falling and echoing in its important contribution to the atmosphere of this unusual, original and engrossing work."<br></br>
Stringsing (1992):

Stephen Barber, Event Magazine: "This was a powerful, engrossing and disturbing piece."<br></br>
Ramsey Burt, Yorkshire Evening Post: "Julie Wilson’s choreographed duets and the Margaret Lucy Wilkins music for Strung Out start at maximum emotional pitch so that one wonders how they can possibly develop - but they do, in a bleak look at a relationship gone sour."<br></br>
Three Skelmanthorpe Carols (1980):

Wakefield Examiner: "Such is their high musical quality there is no doubt that the carols will grace many a Christmas program for years to come."<br></br></p>
